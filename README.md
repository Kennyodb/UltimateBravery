# ⚔️ League of Legends Ultimate Bravery

A fun and interactive web application for League of Legends players to experience the ultimate challenge! Roll a random League of Legends champion, build, summoner spells, and ability leveling order, then accept the bravery challenge!

## ⚡ Quick Start


### Develop Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

## 🔄 Data Updates

This project pulls champion, item, and summoner spell data from Riot's Data Dragon API.

- Online update (default) - downloads data and icons:
  ```bash
  npm run update-data

  ```

Generated files:
- `data/champions.json`

- `data/runes.json`
- `data/metadata.json`

Downloaded icons:
- `images/champions/*.png` - Champion portraits
